## Overview

In the realm of food delivery services, precision in delivery time estimation is crucial for customer satisfaction. This project delves into the optimization of food delivery efficiency by leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically using an LSTM Neural Network. The system analyzes historical data, considering vital factors such as order details and distances, to enhance logistics and provide accurate delivery time estimates.

### Key Features:

- **LSTM Neural Network:** The project employs the power of Long Short-Term Memory networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in historical delivery data.

- **Data-driven Optimization:** Deep learning techniques are applied to historical data from CSV files, allowing the model to learn and adapt to various factors influencing delivery times.

- **Logistics Enhancement:** By considering order details and distances, the system aims to optimize the entire food delivery process, resulting in more reliable and precise delivery time predictions.

### Goals:

1. **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** Accurate delivery time estimates contribute to enhanced customer satisfaction by setting clear expectations and reducing uncertainty.

2. **Efficient Logistics:** The utilization of deep learning techniques aids in the optimization of logistics, ensuring a streamlined and efficient food delivery process.

3. **Adaptability to Dynamic Factors:** Real-time data, including traffic conditions, is integrated to make dynamic adjustments, providing accurate predictions even in the face of changing external factors.

This project is not just about predicting delivery times; it's a step towards revolutionizing the food delivery industry by harnessing the power of data and deep learning to create a more efficient and customer-centric experience.
